# Build a Website Design System

## Project Goals
Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building your own basic design system for a website. In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On your site, you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.

Your style guide should include a labeled section outlining the colors to be used.


Your style should include a labeled section of the fonts to be used (we recommend importing fonts from Google Fonts).

In addition to the list of possible fonts, your style guide should include a section for specific text styles for page elements. For example, you could set main heading (`<h1>`) guidelines about text size, fonts, font styles, font weight, and more.

Include at least 3 element styles, and ideally as many as you’d like to use in future sites.Add any additional styles that you’d like to include to make your style guide/design system look great. This could include positioning, layout, additional colors, box model properties, and more.
