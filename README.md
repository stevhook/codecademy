<h1>codecademy-challenges</h1>
As part of my learning I have been completing codecademy projects and challenges. The challenges are small applied exercises which have become more complex and now require me to do my work in my own IDE (rather than the web box offered). This is a repository of the code I've used to solve these challenges.
