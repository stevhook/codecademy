# Codecademy

As part of my learning, I have been completing Codecademy courses. My progress can be seen on my [Codecademy profile](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Stev1202).

Various parts of the courses set challenges, and as these have become more complex, I have decided to store the solutions in this repository.

## Challenges

* Web Development Foundations
    * [Tea Cozy](https://github.com/stevhook/codecademy-challenges/tree/main/web-development-foundations/Tea-Cozy)
* Building Interactive Websites
    * [Mysterious Organism](https://github.com/stevhook/codecademy-challenges/tree/main/Interactive-Websites/Mysterious-Organism)
