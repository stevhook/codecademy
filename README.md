<h1>Codecademy</h1>
As part of my learning I have been completing codecademy courses. My progress can be seen on my <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Stev1202'>Codecademy profile</a>. 
    
Various parts of the courses set challengesand as these have become more complex I have decided to store the solutions in this repository.
