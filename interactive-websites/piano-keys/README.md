# Piano Keys

## Project Goals

**Context:** Youâ€™re a web developer who has been hired by a music education company. This client wants you to create an interactive game to help their beginner-level piano students study. Create a piano player with DOM events in JavaScript!

## My notes

This reinforced my learning of:

* DOM events
* combining JavaScript with html
