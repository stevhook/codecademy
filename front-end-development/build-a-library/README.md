# Build a Library

## Project Goals
Congratulations, you’ve become head librarian at your local Books-‘N-Stuff, which is in dire need of your help. They’re still using index cards to organize their content! Yikes.

But no matter, you know some JavaScript, so let’s get to work modernizing your new digs.

Books-‘N-Stuff carries three different types of media: books, CDs, and movies. In this project you will create a parent class named `Media` with three subclasses: `Book`, `Movie`, and `CD`. These three subclasses have the following properties and methods:

**Book**
* Properties: `author` (string), `title` (string), `pages` (number), `isCheckedOut` (boolean, initially false), and `ratings` (array, initially empty).
* Getters: all properties have a getter
* Methods: `.getAverageRating()`, `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and `.addRating()`

**Movie**
* Properties: `director` (string), `title` (string), runTime (number), `isCheckedOut` (boolean, initially false), and `ratings` (array, initially empty)
* Getters: all properties have a getter
* Methods: `.getAverageRating()`, `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and `.addRating()`

**CD**
* Properties: `artist` (string), `title` (string), `isCheckedOut` (boolean, initially false), and `ratings` (array, initially empty), `songs` (array of strings)
* Getters: all properties have a getter
* Methods: `.getAverageRating()`, `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and .addRating()

## Extension

If you would like to continue working on this project, we have listed some avenues to build on your existing progress.
* Add more properties to each class (movieCast, songTitles, etc.)
* Create a CD class that extends Media.
* In .addRating(), make sure input is between 1 and 5.
* Create a method called shuffle for the CD class. The method returns a randomly sorted array of all the songs in the songs property.
* Create class called Catalog that holds all of the Media items in our library.
