Plan notes
===

## Ideas
- Soothsayer will produce predictive messages based on random number generation
- It will consist of 3 storage arrays which it will pick message components from
- Core functionality will take three random items from each array and combine them returning a complete message

## User story
I am creating a user story to avoid scope creep, while also giving me the option to expand on this in future.
- As a user, I want to be able to generate a random message so that my question about the future is answered.
