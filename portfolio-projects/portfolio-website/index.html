    <h1>Hi I'm Stev.</h1>
    <p>I've been interested in coding for the last year after switching to a technology role at work. I've been trying to expose myself to as much as I can at work and learning in my off time using Codecademy.</p>
    
 
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>I have been learning to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git. I have also been uploading projects onto <a href="https://github.com/stevhook" target="_blank">my GitHub</a> and I've also added an interactive element to this page to swap between CSS themes.</p>
    <div class="theme-btn">
      <button class="changeTheme" role="button" id="themeBtn">Change Theme</button>
